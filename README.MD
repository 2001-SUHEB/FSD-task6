This repository contains two JavaScript files:

1. `person-details.js`: This file contains a class definition to store details about a person. You can create instances of this class to store information such as name, age, and location.

2. `UberPriceCalculator.js`: This file contains a class definition to calculate the price for an Uber ride based on the distance traveled. It takes into account factors such as base fare per mile and surge pricing (if applicable).
